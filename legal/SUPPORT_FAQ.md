## Getting Started

### Q: Do I need to create an account?
**A:** No! RendioAI uses anonymous authentication. When you first open the app, a guest account is created automatically using Apple's DeviceCheck. No email or password required.

**Want a registered account?** Upgrade to Apple Sign-In (coming soon) to sync across devices.

---

### Q: How do I get started?
**A:** Simple! Just:
1. Open the app
2. You'll receive 10 FREE credits automatically
3. Tap any video model
4. Enter a text description
5. Tap "Generate Video"
6. Wait 40-90 seconds
7. Watch your AI-generated video!

---

### Q: What are the 10 free credits for?
**A:** New users get 10 free credits to try the service. Since 1 credit = 1 second of video, you can generate:
- Two 4-second videos (8 credits) + have 2 left
- One 8-second video + have 2 credits left
- Multiple shorter videos

**Note:** Free credits are granted once per device.

---

## Video Generation

### Q: How long does it take to generate a video?
**A:** Typically **40-90 seconds**, depending on:
- Video duration (longer videos take more time)
- Backend load (peak times may be slower)
- AI model complexity

**Tip:** Start with 4-second videos for faster results!

---

### Q: What makes a good prompt?
**A:** Great prompts are:
- **Descriptive:** "sunset over mountains with fog" (not just "sunset")
- **Specific:** Include details like colors, lighting, camera movement
- **Concise:** 10-30 words is ideal
- **Clear:** Avoid contradictory descriptions

**Examples of good prompts:**
- ✅ "Ocean waves crashing on rocky shore at golden hour"
- ✅ "Colorful geometric shapes morphing slowly, abstract art style"
- ✅ "Forest path with sunlight streaming through trees, cinematic"

**Examples of poor prompts:**
- ❌ "Nice scenery" (too vague)
- ❌ "Cat playing piano while flying over New York" (too complex/contradictory)

---

### Q: Why did my video generation fail?
**A:** Failures are rare (<1%) but can happen due to:
- Backend timeout
- FalAI API error
- Network connectivity issue
- Prohibited content in prompt

**What happens:** You'll see an error message, and **credits are automatically refunded**.

**What to do:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a simpler prompt
3. Tap "Retry"
4. If it keeps failing, contact support@rendio.ai

---

### Q: Can I edit the video after generation?
**A:** Currently, no. RendioAI generates final videos that you can download and use. Editing features may be added in future updates.

**Workaround:** Download the video and use a third-party video editor (iMovie, etc.).

---

### Q: Can I regenerate a video with the same prompt?
**A:** Yes! In the History tab:
1. Tap any previous video
2. Tap "Regenerate"
3. The prompt and settings are pre-filled
4. Tap "Generate" again

**Note:** Each generation uses credits (even with the same prompt). AI may produce slightly different results each time.

---

### Q: What video formats are supported?
**A:** Videos are generated in **MP4 format** (H.264 codec), compatible with:
- iPhone/iPad Photos app
- Instagram, TikTok, YouTube
- Most video editing software
- All major platforms

---

## Credits & Purchases

### Q: What are credits?
**A:** Credits are the virtual currency used to generate videos. **1 credit = 1 second** of video.

**Example:**
- 4-second video = 4 credits
- 8-second video = 8 credits
- 12-second video = 12 credits

---

### Q: How do I buy more credits?

2. Tap "Buy Credits"

### Q: Do credits expire?
**A:** No! Credits **never expire**. Buy them whenever you want and use them whenever you're ready.

---

### Q: Can I transfer credits to another account?
**A:** No, credits are non-transferable and tied to your account.

**Exception:** If you upgrade from guest to Apple Sign-In, your credits transfer automatically.

---

### Q: What happens if I run out of credits during generation?
**A:** You can't start generation without enough credits. The app checks your balance before starting.

**If you're mid-generation:** The video continues processing (we already deducted credits when you tapped "Generate").

---

### Q: Why was I charged but didn't receive credits?
**A:** This is very rare. Possible causes:

**Solution:**
1. Tap "Restore Purchases" in Profile > Settings
