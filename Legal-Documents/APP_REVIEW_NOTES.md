## Key Features to Test

### 1. Anonymous Authentication (DeviceCheck)
- ✅ **What to test:** App opens without requiring email/password
- ✅ **Expected behavior:** Automatic guest account creation
- ✅ **Credits:** 10 free credits granted immediately
- ✅ **Security:** Uses Apple DeviceCheck API to prevent abuse

**Technical Note:** We use DeviceCheck to:
- Prevent users from getting multiple free credit grants
- Enable anonymous authentication without personal data
- Comply with privacy-first design principles

---

### 2. Video Generation (AI Content)
- ✅ **What to test:** Generate a video from text prompt
- ✅ **Expected behavior:**
  - Loading screen with progress indicator
  - Video ready in 40-90 seconds (varies by backend load)

**Important for Reviewers:**

## Non-Obvious Features Explained

### 1. Why Anonymous Authentication?
**Privacy-first design:**
- No email or password required
- No personal information collected
- DeviceCheck prevents abuse without tracking users
- Compliant with GDPR and privacy best practices

**How it works:**
- iOS generates a DeviceCheck token (cryptographic proof of device)
- Backend verifies token with Apple servers
- Backend creates anonymous Supabase auth session
- JWT token stored securely in iOS Keychain

---

### 2. Why Credit System Instead of Subscriptions?
**Fair pricing model:**
- Users pay only for what they use
- No recurring charges or commitments
- Transparent: 1 credit = 1 second (easy to understand)
- Credits never expire

**Prevents abuse:**
- Rate limiting: Max 10 videos per hour
- DeviceCheck ensures one free grant per device
- Atomic credit operations prevent double-charging

---

### 3. Why 7-Day Video Retention?
**Privacy and storage:**
- Reduces storage costs
- Limits data retention (GDPR-friendly)
- Encourages users to download important videos
- Automatic cleanup ensures compliance

**Future:** We plan to offer longer retention for paid tiers.

---

### 4. How We Prevent Inappropriate Content
**Multi-layer approach:**
1. **Pre-generation filtering:** Prompts scanned for prohibited keywords
2. **AI safety filters:** FalAI models have built-in content moderation
3. **User reporting:** Every video has "Report" button
4. **Manual review:** Reports reviewed within 48 hours
5. **Acceptable Use Policy:** Clear guidelines for users

**What's Prohibited:**
- Sexual/pornographic content
- Extreme violence or gore
- Hate speech or harassment
- Copyright/trademark infringement
- Illegal activities

See: Acceptable Use Policy at https://rendio.ai/acceptable-use

## Known Limitations

### 1. Generation Time Variability
- **Normal:** 40-60 seconds
- **Peak times:** Up to 90 seconds
- **Depends on:** Backend load, video complexity, FalAI queue

**Why:** AI video generation is computationally expensive. We use queuing to handle load.

---

### 2. Occasional Generation Failures
- **Frequency:** <1% of generations
- **Causes:** Backend timeout, FalAI API errors, network issues
- **User impact:** Error message + automatic credit refund
- **Mitigation:** Retry button, detailed error messages

---

### 3. AI Quality Variations
- **Expected:** AI is not perfect; results vary by prompt
- **Examples:** Artifacts, unexpected elements, prompt misinterpretation
- **Disclosure:** Clearly stated in app and Terms of Service
- **Improvement:** AI models improve over time

---

## Compliance & Legal

### Age Rating: 12+
**Reasons:**
- User-Generated Content: YES (AI-generated videos)
- Unrestricted Web Access: NO (API usage ≠ web browsing)
- Mature/Suggestive Themes: NO (safety filters prevent this)

**Appropriate rating:** 12+ (accounts for potential edge cases in AI generation)

---

### Export Compliance
**Encryption:** App uses standard iOS encryption (HTTPS, Keychain)
- **Export Compliance:** Uses encryption for:
  - Network communication (TLS 1.3)
  - Local data storage (iOS Keychain)
  - All standard iOS APIs (no custom crypto)

**Answer in App Store Connect:**
- Uses encryption: YES
- Encryption is standard iOS: YES
- Qualifies for exemption: YES (use of standard encryption)

---

### Privacy Manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy)
**Included:** [If implemented]
- Declares Required Reason APIs (UserDefaults, Keychain)
- No third-party SDKs with tracking
- No use of IDFA

**Status:** ✅ Completed / ⚠️ In Progress

## Common Questions Anticipated

**Q: Why do you need DeviceCheck?**
A: To prevent credit fraud. Without it, users could reinstall the app repeatedly to get unlimited free credits. DeviceCheck allows us to verify "this device already received free credits" without collecting personal data.

**Q: Why is content moderation needed for AI-generated videos?**
A: Apple classifies AI-generated content as "User-Generated Content." Even though it's AI, users control what's generated (via prompts), so moderation is required to prevent abuse.

**Q: Can users generate inappropriate content?**
A: We use multiple layers of protection:
1. Prompt filtering (rejects prohibited keywords)
2. AI safety filters (built into FalAI models)
3. User reporting system
4. Manual review of reports
5. Acceptable Use Policy

**Q: What happens if generation fails?**
A: Credits are automatically refunded. Users see an error message with a "Retry" button. Failures are rare (<1%) and usually due to backend timeout or FalAI API issues.

**Q: Why 7-day video retention?**
A: Privacy and storage efficiency. Users can download videos they want to keep. This also complies with data minimization principles (GDPR). Future versions may offer longer retention for paid users.

**Q: Is data shared with third parties?**
A: Only for core functionality:
- FalAI: Receives prompts to generate videos (required for service)
- Apple: Handles IAP transactions (required for payments)
- Supabase: Backend infrastructure (required for data storage)

No data sold or shared for marketing/advertising.
